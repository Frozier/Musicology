# Musicology

The corpus is a playlist of songs picked from various bands from different countries/regions in the world. I chose this corpus because I wanted to learn more about the differences in music styles from different regions. The bands that are included are RADWIMPS, The Script, ONE OK ROCK and Day6. The songs are picked such that they all follow somewhat the same trend in terms of genre, namely pop (rock), instead of mixing it with genres such as heavy metal. Apart from the regional differences, there are other interesting things about the included songs. RADWIMPS and ONE OK ROCK for example are both bands that originate from Japan, however one of them has western influences such as mainly singing in English, and the other has some songs that are written for films, though they all have vocals and still follow a similar genre as the other bands. The Script is an Irish band and Day6 originates from South-Korea. Even though bands and artists from different regions in the world can write music in similar genres, their music styles are often considered to be noticably different, and artists themselves may be very aware of this. One example is how the vocals are used for the melodies, or the difference in instrumentation. For the purposes of this project we're analysing music mainly based on geographic location and how music styles differ or resemble.
